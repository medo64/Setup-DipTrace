Board design principles
-----------------------

BOARD SIZES

   Board sizes are selected based on Phoenix's UMK board series. Board
   height is always 72.0 millimeters. Width is selected from 20.0, 42.5,
   65.0, or any other multiple of 22.5 millimeters (starting at 20.0).

   o 20.0 x 72.0 mm 1440 mm2) / 0.79 x 2.83 in (2.23 in2)
      - Outer size (mm)        : 16.80 x 66.00
      - Outer rectangle (mm)   : 1.60, 69.00; 18.40, 3.00
      - Internal size (mm)     : 15.24 x 63.50
      - Internal rectangle (mm): 2.38, 67.75; 17.62, 4.25
      - Internal offset (mm)   : 3.65, 5.52
      - Via count              : 6 x 25 (150)

   o 42.5 x 72.0 mm (2060 mm2) / 1.67 x 2.83 in (4.74 in2)

      - Outer size (mm)        : 39.30 x 66.00

      - Internal offset (mm)   : 3.29, 5.52
      - Via count              : 24 x 25 (600)


BOARD LAYOUT

   Inputs jacks are preferred to be on left side and outputs should
   gravitate towards right. Up and down should be cleared of all jacks
   that could go over border.

   Jacks that are horizontally mounted should go over right or left edge
   by 1.25 millimeters (border size of UMK-SE 11.25 enclosure element).


TRACES

   Default trace width is 30 mil. That should withstand aproximately
   500mA of current (as per IPC-2221A, internal traces, 1/2 oz) with
   10°C temperature increase.

   Standard values are defined in following table. Width and clearance
   are given in mils and current is given in milliampers.

      Width  Clear  Current
         10     10      250
         15     15      350
         20     15      400
         30     15      500
         40     20      650
         50     20      750

POWER INTERFACE

   Boards with serial connection should use 12V as input. USB based
   boards should take 5V from USB if current required is below 500mA. If
   higher voltage or current is needed, separate power input should be
   provided via independent power source at 12V (preffered).


SERIAL DATA INTERFACE

   Physical layes

      Only three wires should be used: RXD, TXD and GND. Use of other
      lines is not encouraged. In case of USB based communication, same
      lines should be taken from USB controller chip (e.g. FT232RL).

      Preffered serial data format is 9600,N,8,1 (9600 baud rate, no
      parity, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit). If higher baud rate is desired
      it should be selected from one of following: 19200, 38400, 57600
      and 115200. Lower baud rates are generally not used but if need
      really occurs (e.g. long communication lines), it should be
      selected among following: 4800, 2400 and 1200.

   Data format

      Data is sent as ASCII whenever this is possible. Binary
      communication should not be used. If binary data is desirable,
      hexadecimal representation in ASCII should be used.

      All input terminates with LF (0x0A). Device should execute desired
      operation only when LF is detected. General format would be
      {data}<LF> (e.g. 123<LF>). Device must not behave erradicaly even
      if data without LF is not supported (because of auto-discovery).

      Device should send back identitification of itself when LF without
      any data is received. Identification should be in format
      {name} {revision}-{date} (e.g. Elsidi A-0904).

      Interface toward device should be implemented as "pull" operation.
      Device should avoid sending anything without being requested to.
      If just general enquiry of state is desired, question mark can be
      used (e.g. ?<LF>).

      If full command is not received and more than one second passes,
      device can clear it's buffer and ignore command.

   Auto-discovery

      Auto discovery works by connecting to each COM port at 9600,N,8,1.
      After sucessfull connection serial line should be cleared and
      single LF (0x0A) should be sent. Answer should be in format {name}
      {revision}-{date}<LF> (e.g. "Elsidi A-1012" for device board
      revision A, manufactured in December, 2010). If desired answer is
      received, searching can be stopped. If desired answer is not
      received, search continues with next port. If no desired port is
      found, search can continue with higher baud rates.
